# Guess the Word Game 

This code mimics the hangman game. There 3 categories to choose from 'Movies/Capital Cities/Languages'.The word to be guessed is randomly selected. Once the category is chosen,the length of the word to be guessed appears. The input is of string type. 
The number of guesses that can be made is the length of the word to be guessed + 10. 
Currently the game can be played six times continuously,without exiting the current execution, if the number of turns are equal to six then the execution of the code is automatically ended.
The input should be given one character at a time,if multiple characters given at a time can result in incorrect word being given as input.
